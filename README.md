i've moved all my repos and snippets to ~~[my own gitlab](about:blank)~~.  
edit july 2025: i'll be moving again all my stuff to somewhere yet another, as gitlab turned out not quite fit for me.  
this github account will be remaining only for github-centred activities, such as contributing enterprise projects and open source projects whose repos are in github.

for other info about me, refer to [my hub site](https://who.miyaco.me).
